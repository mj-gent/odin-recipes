        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                For everyone who loves steak but is a bit scared to try cooking 
                one on their own, pan-searing is a simple, yet effective way to 
                get the most out of your beginner skills.

                As for choosing the right "cut", the terminology is nothing to
                worry about. Ribeye is solid choice, but the important thing 
                to know is that the cut is thick enough. Aim for a cut that
                is <strong>at least an inch thick</strong>; a little larger is
                fine, but don't go any thinner.
            </p>

                As for the seasonings, salt is the most vital of all and a
                coarse salt is nicer if possible, but the rest of the
                seasonings should simply be things you want to taste
                on your steak. My recipe is just an example.
