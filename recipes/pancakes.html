        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Instead of using pre-made pancake mix, consider having these household items on hand for this breakfast classic.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour; 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups</li>
            <li>Baking Powder; 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons</li>
            <li>White sugar; 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Milk; 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups</li>
            <li>Melted Butter; 3 tablespoons</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place all dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl and mix them together until even.</li>
            <li>Add all wet ingredients to the mixing bowl, mixing until the solids and liquids have
                completely combined. There should be no remaining solid clumps left stuck to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan on the stovetop at a low-medium heat.</li>
            <li>Using a pat of butter (use more that you didn't add to the mixing bowl), melt it in
                the heated pan to prevent your pancake batter from sticking to the pan.</li>
            <li>Into the pan, pour batter from the bowl in the size of a single pancake. It should be
                slightly bigger than the area covered by your spatula.</li>
            <li>The pancake will be ready to flip when you see bubbles begin to rise in the heating batter.
                Takes about 3-5 minutes, but you may also gently check the underside as you see fit.</li>
            <li>Flip pancake, and allow to cook on this side for another 3 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>You have finished cooking a pancake! Transfer it from the pan to a serving plate.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Repeat from step 4 onward</em></strong> until you have run out of pancake batter</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you would like to add spices, such as cinnamon or nutmeg, add
            them with the dry ingredients in <strong><em>step 1</em></strong>. If you would like to add extra
            ingredients, such as mashed bananas or chocolate chips, add them with the wet ingredients
            in <strong><em>step 2</em></strong>. Or, you could add them to the batter after having mixed 
            the basic dry and wet ingredients, I'm not even sure how much it matters.
